 Tips and Tricks.<br>Enjoy your stay!! </h1>
		<h2>World Gen</h2>
		<p>Making a world that suits your fitting is vital to your success in the game.</p>
		<p>If you want a easy game, choose a biome that isn't too cold or isn't to hot OR has year-round growing. Both would be great.</p>
		<p> Dont spawn near pirates or raiders. You'd have a bad time. </p>
		<p>Mountains are by far the hardest to be on as when you mine the mountains rock will fall and could kill your people.</p>
		<p>Make you are in a place lower than 90F and higher than 20F.</p>
		<a href="seeds.html"> Here are some good seeds!</a>
		<h2>Character Picking</h2>
		<p>Make sure you have a character you want and they are useful to your colonists.</p>
		<p>Very important stats are: Medicene,Construction,Cooking,Reasearch and animals. Randomize until you get a good character.</p>
		<p>Also try not to have so many sick character ex: Asthma,Bad back, frail etc.</p>
		<p>As of Alpha 14, if you want to choose your skills and traits in EdB Prepare Carefully and do whatever you want with it!</p>
		<p>Also, to enhance gameplay you want to pick good names so you can bear looking at them. Some names are really,really bad.</p>
		<h2>Starting out</h2>
		<p>Starting out you want to build a house/barrack and a kitchen.
		In the barracks make sure to go ahead and put beds (how many colonists you have + one medical bed)</p>
		<p> Then make a stockpile for food, another one for everything else and then one dumping one away from your house for chunks and dead bodies.</p>
		<p> Make sure you have a fueled stove and a butcher table (the butcher table should be wood) and then go to add bills and add whatever you would like!</p>
		<p>Starting out with power is a great benefit to the mood of your people and your defense by alot (ex. Improvised Turrets)</p>
		<p>Make a reasearch room with your reasearch table and try to work up to geothermal power (it is the best power in the game) and if you want to beat the game start getting up to Ship Building to fly up to space!</p>
